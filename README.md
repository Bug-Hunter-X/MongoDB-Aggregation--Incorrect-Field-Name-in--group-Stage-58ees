# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Incorrect Field Name

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: using an incorrect field name within the `$group` stage.  The provided `bug.js` file contains code with this error. The correct solution is in `bugSolution.js`.

The error arises when referencing a field that doesn't exist in the documents or has a different name than what's specified in the pipeline.  This results in either an empty result set or a more subtle error that's difficult to trace.

**Solution:** Carefully review the field names in your documents and ensure they accurately match the field names used in your aggregation pipeline.
